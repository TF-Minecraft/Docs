# Creator stages

## Purpose

Two optional character creator stages for backstory permanent injuries and one prosthetic.

## `stages.yml`

### `permanent_injury_info_stage` (type: info)

- Explain optional backstory injuries, 0 cost, many allowed
- Skippable via `auto-next` / next command like other info stages

### `permanent_injury_selection_stage` (type: selection)

```yaml
type: selection
lock-time: 24h
target: trait
key: injury
filter: permanent-only   # new flag OR filter traits without duration
min-select: 0
max-select: 99           # practical cap or unlimited
# no points
gui-size: 54
slots: [...]
```

Locked 24 hours after character creation (wall-clock age), same as race selection. Staff with `rpchar.edit.bypass-lock` can still edit.

### `prosthetic_info_stage` (type: info)

- Optional, 1 point budget, one prosthetic max
- Arcane fuel disclaimer
- Skippable like evil path

### `prosthetic_selection_stage` (type: selection)

```yaml
type: selection
lock-time: 24h
target: trait
key: prosthetic
min-select: 0
max-select: 1
points: 1
gui-size: 54
slots: [...]
```

Also locked 24 hours after character creation.

## Prosthetic-wins sanitize

If a character owns a prosthetic and the matching backstory permanent injury (see `prosthetics.yml` replacements, e.g. `one_handed` / `one_legged`), the injury is removed automatically:

- On injury or prosthetic selection confirm (`SelectionStage`)
- On edit save / return to summary (`CharacterCreation.persistEdits`)
- On creation finish (`CharacterCreation.finish`)
- On web create submit and wizard trait changes (ProvinceSystem)

Prosthetic always wins; players cannot keep both via re-editing the injury stage within the lock window.

## `SelectionStage` / `InventoryManager` changes

- **`filter: permanent-only`:** options = `key: injury` and trait has no `duration`
- **Icons:** distinct material/icon per injury and prosthetic tier (config or convention)
- **Skip:** allow confirm with 0 selections (like evil min-select 0)
- **Prosthetic from creator:** add trait with full fuel if arcane

## Stage graph (`stages.yml` next map)

Insert after personality or before finish, parallel to evil branch skippability.

## Web messages

Both info stages use `web-messages` for the ProvinceSystem creator.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Can pick multiple permanent injuries, 0 points
- [ ] Can pick at most one prosthetic, costs 1 point
- [ ] Prosthetic selectable without permanent injury
- [ ] Injury/prosthetic selection locked 24h after creation

- [ ] All option icons distinct and clear
