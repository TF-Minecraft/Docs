## Planned

| Feature | Description |

| **Map chronicle** | Daily composited snapshot + structured event log (war declared, province taken, capital moved, …) |
| **Wealth charts** | Nation and global wealth time series over the season |
| **Occupation overlay** | Distinct contested fill on political modes (occupier colour remap already ships; not blocked on SF export) |

War gameplay and export schema live in SimpleFactions: see [`../../simplefactions/docs/wars.md`](https://github.com/TF-Minecraft/SimpleFactions/blob/ad9b048ec42c1842b277f4657f490b25691f854d/docs/wars.md).

## Success criteria (platform)

**Map**

- Borders update from SimpleFactions without manual image editing.
- Parchment terrain + muted political layers; nation detail modals; staff map gates.
- Daily chronicle snapshots + wealth charts over the season (planned).

**Skins**

- Link Discord → code → upload → Discord approve → ArmourShop writes pack → player can apply skin.
- Naming enforced; no shareable codes granting another UUID the cosmetic.

**Drinks**

- `/token create drink` → `/drinks` → Discord approve → DrinkBuilder → BreweryX.
- Shared mint cooldown with skins on TFMCWeb.

**Bot**

- Staff review skins and drinks in Discord.
- Ban/warn notifies via DM; Banned role add/clear; MC bans remain Essentials.

**TFMCWeb**

- Single plugin HTTP gateway for domain plugins; Survival Discord gate; scoped tokens.

**Ops**

- Local demo of website without live plugins.
- Deferred pack/map regen when the server is empty or on restart where required.
