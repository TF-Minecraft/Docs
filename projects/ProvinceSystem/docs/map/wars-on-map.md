# Wars on the web map

Website-side war visualization only. War **gameplay**, FSM, and export schema live in SimpleFactions: [`../../simplefactions/docs/wars.md`](https://github.com/TF-Minecraft/ProvinceSystem/blob/9b34fd3fd336af9025ca187ca9610690695c0efa/simplefactions/docs/wars.md).

## Shipped (website)

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Campaign route line** | Axis/path between campaign waypoints from SF `wars` export |
| **Battle pins** | Scheduled battle locations on the map with tooltip metadata |
| **Occupier nation fill** | Political overlay remaps `province_data[].occupied_by` tiles to the occupier colour (slightly greyer). Labels use `occupied_held`. |
| **Campaign-line front** | `occupied_by_attacker[]` on `wars[]` advances the dotted front along the axis |

Data arrives via SimpleFactions nation/war upload. The website **does not infer** frontlines from territory diffs alone.

## Planned

| Layer | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Occupation overlay** | Distinct contested fill on political modes (separate from occupier colour remap) | SF already exports `occupied_by_*` and `province_data.occupied_by`. This is a visual layer, not an export blocker. |
| **Map chronicle** | Structured events (`war_declared`, battle, occupy, end) | SF hooks not emitted yet |

See [roadmap.md](../roadmap.md).

## Data contract (summary)

From SF war export (see SimpleFactions docs):

- Belligerent nation ids
- Campaign route polyline or waypoint list for the route line layer
- Battle schedule entries with map coordinates for pins
- Occupation: `occupied_by_attacker[]` / `occupied_by_defender[]` on `wars[]`; `occupied_by` on `province_data` for occupier fill

ProvinceSystem reads war JSON from the same upload/regen path as other map markers. Pipeline detail: [generation.md](generation.md).

## Rendering rules

- War overlays compose **above** political fills but respect pick-layer separation (hover still uses pick canvas).
- Multiple concurrent wars may each get a `war_{id}` layer key.
- Pins and route lines use muted cartography colours consistent with [overview.md](overview.md) ink style.

## Staff / public access

War layers follow the same map access rules as the parent `mapId`. Staff-only maps hide war data from players without `tfmc.map.staff`. See [identity/auth-security.md](../identity/auth-security.md).
