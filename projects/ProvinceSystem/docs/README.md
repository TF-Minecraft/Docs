# ProvinceSystem documentation

**tfminecraft.net** is the TFMC web hub: interactive political maps, donator cosmetics (skins and drinks), character creation, and identity services backed by a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend.

This section is the product and technical reference for **ProvinceSystem**. Technical documentation for TF-Minecraft repositories is maintained together in [TF-Minecraft/docs](../../../README.md).

## Locked platform decisions

- **Name:** TFMC = TF Minecraft. "TF" has no expansion.
- **No site logins** - skins, drinks, and characters use TFMCWeb-issued UUID-bound codes; redeem → API session (8h default; character Remember me = 30d).
- **Shared cosmetic mint cooldown** - skin + drink share one clock on **TFMCWeb** (not ProvinceSystem).
- **Discord link** - in-game `/linkdiscord` + Discord `/linkdiscord <code>`; required before upload.
- **SQLite + disk** for skins/drinks metadata and pending files on the API.
- **SimpleFactions = map only**; **ArmourShop = skins pack writer**; **TFMCWeb = identity + web transport**.
