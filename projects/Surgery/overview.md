# Surgery

**A Minecraft server plugin that turns healing into a mini-game — open a surgery GUI on another player, diagnose one of 29 ailments, and operate with 14 tools while managing vitals, bleeding, and death timers.**

## What It Does

Run `/surgery <player>` next to a patient and a surgery GUI opens: colored status blocks show the patient's consciousness, pulse, temperature, and operation-site cleanliness, while the toolbar holds your surgical instruments. Diagnose with the ultrasound, anesthetize, cut, manage whatever goes wrong, fix the problem, and stitch up — or lose the patient to fever, bleeding, or cardiac arrest.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Interactive surgery GUI** | Inventory-based operating table with live colored status indicators |
| **29 diagnoses** | Injuries, infections, tumors, flu strains, and mysterious ailments — randomly assigned per operation |
| **14 surgical tools** | Scalpel, sponge, stitches, defibrillator, transfusion, and more — each with a specific job |
| **Live patient vitals** | Temperature, pulse, consciousness, and bleeding all shift as the surgery progresses |
| **Skill-fail mechanics** | Every move can fail; bleeding raises the fail chance, sponging lowers it |
| **Bone surgery** | Broken and shattered bones revealed by incisions, repaired with pins and splints |
| **Diagnosis-specific twists** | Flu strains need an exact temperature; Arcane Infection causes random chaos; Lupus patients howl |
| **Time pressure** | Cardiac-arrest countdowns, weak-pulse timers, and hyperthermia death thresholds |
| **Config-driven design** | Diagnoses, incision counts, fail chances, timers, tool items, and all messages live in YAML |

## How It Works

The `/surgery <player>` command validates that the patient is online and within range (5 blocks by default), then opens the surgery menu:

1. `SurgeryMenuBuilder` lays out the GUI and rolls a random diagnosis (hidden until ultrasound) plus the patient's starting vitals and bone state.
2. Every tool click routes through `SurgeryItemHandler`, which resolves the clicked item against the configured TLibs item paths and applies the tool's effect.
3. After each move, `SurgeryMechanicsManager` advances the simulation: temperature rises unless the site is clean, pulse can degrade while bleeding, countdowns tick, and diagnosis-specific mechanics fire.
4. `SurgeryUIUpdater` repaints the status blocks (patient status, pulse, temperature, operation site) with color-coded concrete.
5. `SurgeryCompletionHandler` checks win/lose conditions — a finished surgery runs the configured success console command; a death runs the failure command. Closing the inventory mid-operation abandons (and fails) the surgery.

All per-patient state lives in `SurgeryStateManager` maps keyed by player UUID and is cleaned up when the surgery ends.

## Architecture

One manager per concern, wired together by `SurgeryMenuManager`:

### Design decisions

- **Configuration over code** — diagnoses, incision requirements, bone counts, fail chances, temperature thresholds, death timers, and every player-facing message are YAML edits, not releases.
- **State manager as single source of truth** — all patient state sits in UUID-keyed maps in one class, so cleanup on completion/abandonment is one call and nothing leaks between surgeries.
- **Abstraction over item plugins** — surgical tools resolve through the TLibs `ItemAPI`, so one config format covers MMOItems, ItemsAdder, and vanilla items with a one-character prefix.

## Installation

1. Drop `surgery-1.2.0.jar` into your server's `plugins/` folder
2. Install **TLibs** (required). **MMOItems** / **ItemsAdder** are optional item sources
3. Restart the server
4. Configure `plugins/surgery/config.yml`, `messages.yml`, and `surgeryItemsConfig.yml` as needed
5. Make sure players can obtain the surgical tool items

### Requirements

| Dependency | Required |
|---|---|
| [Paper](https://papermc.io/) 1.21.10 | TFMC runtime target |
| Java | Follow the [shared runtime and build baseline](../../PLATFORM.md); this plugin targets Java 21 bytecode |
| [TLibs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tlibs.127713/) | Yes |
| [MMOItems](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mmoitems-premium.39267/) | Optional |
| [ItemsAdder](https://itemsadder.com/) | Optional |

## Usage

| Command | Description | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `/surgery <player>` | Open the surgery menu for the target patient | (default) |

### Performing a surgery

1. **Start**: `/surgery <player>` with the patient within 5 blocks
2. **Diagnose** with the **Ultrasound**
3. **Anesthetize** — cutting an awake patient fails the surgery
4. **Check vitals** with the **Lab Kit** (temperature, pulse, status, bleeding)
5. **Make incisions** with the **Scalpel** until the diagnosis's required count
6. **Manage complications**: **Sponge** for blood, **Clamp** for severe bleeding, **Antiseptic** for site cleanliness, **Antibiotics** for fever, **Transfusion** for weak pulse, **Defibrillator** for cardiac arrest
7. **Repair bones** (if revealed) with **Pins** (broken) and **Splint** (shattered)
8. **Fix** the problem with the **Surgical Glove** once all conditions are met
9. **Close up** with **Stitches**, then click **Finish Surgery**

### Surgical tools

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ultrasound** | Diagnose patient | Assigns the hidden random diagnosis |
| **Lab Kit** | Check patient vitals | Shows temperature, pulse, status |
| **Anesthetic** | Put patient to sleep | Required before cutting; has a reuse cooldown |
| **Scalpel** | Make incisions | Can cause bleeding and pulse drops |
| **Sponge** | Clear blood | Reduces skill-fail chance while active |
| **Antiseptic** | Clean operation site | Stops temperature rise |
| **Stitches** | Close incisions | Required before finishing |
| **Antibiotics** | Control temperature | ±5.4°F random change |
| **Surgical Glove** | Fix the problem | Unlocks once incisions/bones/flu-temp conditions are met |
| **Defibrillator** | Restart heart | Available during cardiac arrest countdown |
| **Surgical Pins** | Fix broken bones | Available when bones are revealed |
| **Surgical Splint** | Fix shattered bones | Available when shattered bones are revealed |
| **Surgical Clamp** | Stop bleeding | Available while bleeding |
| **Transfusion** | Restore pulse | Improves pulse by 1–2 levels |

### Failure conditions

- Temperature exceeds 110°F (hyperthermia)
- Cardiac-arrest countdown expires without defibrillation
- Too many consecutive turns with extremely weak pulse
- Patient bleeds out
- Cutting while the patient is awake
- Closing the surgery menu mid-operation

### Special diagnosis mechanics

| Diagnosis | Twist |
|---|---|
| **Flu strains** (Bird/Turtle/Monkey) | Temperature must be exactly 98.6°F to use the Surgical Glove |
| **Moldy Guts** | Forced bleeding every 3–4 moves |
| **Fatty Liver** | 20% chance the heart stops while unconscious |
| **Broken Heart** | 35% chance the heart stops while unconscious |
| **Arcane Infection** | 25% chaos chance per move: random temperature spikes/drops and status changes |
| **Lupus** | 15% chance the patient howls, causing an incision + bleeding |
| **Paper Cuts** | Requires 2 scalpel uses to examine the wounds |

### Status indicators

The GUI uses colored concrete blocks for at-a-glance vitals:

| Indicator | Levels | Colors |
|---|---|---|
| **Patient Status** | Awake / Unconscious / Heart Stopped / Coming to | Yellow / Lime / Red / Orange |
| **Pulse** | Strong / Steady / Weak / Extremely Weak | Lime / Yellow / Orange / Red |
| **Temperature** | ≤100 / 101–104 / 105–106 / 107+ °F | Lime / Yellow / Orange / Red |
| **Operation Site** | Clean / Not sanitized / Unclean / Unsanitary | Lime / Yellow / Orange / Red |

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TF-Minecraft/TLibs.git tlibs
git clone https://github.com/TF-Minecraft/Surgery.git surgery
cd surgery
python3 ../tlibs/tools/install-dependency.py --pom pom.xml
mvn package
```

Use JDK 21, Maven and Python 3. The shared installer verifies the pinned release checksum; see [TLibs dependency setup](../TLibs/README.md). Install the matching `me.plugins:tlibs:1.1.0` artifact as described in the [shared baseline](../../PLATFORM.md), then run `mvn clean verify`. Paper API resolves from Maven. The artifact is written to `target/`.

## Tech Stack

- **Java 21 bytecode target** · **Paper API 1.21.10 build dependency** · **Maven**
- TFMC runtime target: **Minecraft 1.21.10**. Build and loader metadata also target 1.21.10; validate releases against the [shared baseline](../../PLATFORM.md).
- Bukkit inventory GUI, event system, and YAML configuration API
- TLibs ItemAPI for cross-plugin item resolution
